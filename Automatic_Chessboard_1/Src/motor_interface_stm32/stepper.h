 * Drives a bipolar stepper motor.
 *
 * When wiring multiple stepper motors to a microcontroller, you quickly run
 * out of output pins, with each motor requiring 4 connections.
 *
 *
 *
 * The sequence of control signals for 4 control wires is as follows:
 *
 * Step A+ A- B+ B-
 *    1  1  0  1  0
 *    2  0  1  1  0
 *    3  0  1  0  1
 *    4  1  0  0  1
